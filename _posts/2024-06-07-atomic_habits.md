# Atomic habits
Atomic habits is a book I have heard a lot about in the field of personal development. So, when I saw it in the bookstore, I could not resist to buy it. 
In this book `Atomic habits, tiny changes, remarkable results` James Clear explains how to slowly build good habits and how to get rid of bad habits. 
The book describes the process of building habits, how to change your mindset about goals and habits and how to hack your mind to make the process easier and funnier. This process comes in a four-laws system established by James Clear that helps you build new habits.

## Power of habits
Building good habits is hard, they may require time and you don't always see the results immediately.
They are building up at a slow pace. What James Clear says is that "work is being store until it explodes" and one day you will see the results of your habits."
Also, "If you can get 1% better every each day for one year, you'll end-up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done". That's a really powerful statement to help you get motivated.

## Habits in four simple steps.
James describes the mental algorithm we go through we realizing an action. This algorithm is made of four simple steps called the habit loop:
* Cue -> A signal you receive that might initiate a crave
* Crave -> An action you want to do following the signal
* Response -> The action you take
* Reward -> The reward you get after realizing an action

For example
- Cue: you enter a dark room
- Crave: You want to see
- Response: You turn on the light
- Reward: You get to see

This process further transforms to the four laws of behavior change

### Don't reach for the goal
One of the first ideas of the book is that to build a new habit, one should not aim at a goal. A goal is something momentary, that restricts happiness and you might drop your habits once the goal is reached. Instead, you should pursue a system. A system is a methodology that you set and will, eventually, lead you to your goal. 
For example, the goal can be to lose weight. The system will be to have a healthy diet and/or exercise more often. 
Beyond the concept of system is that of identity. Think of what is your identity and who you want to be. 
For example, I want to be a healthy person, hence I will eat healthy and exercise more and, on the long run, lose weight. 
Habits shape identity and identity shapes habits. In order to change your habits, you have to change your identity.

### Build habits - four simple laws
James Clear describes a set of four laws in order to build good habits and get rid of bad ones.
I won't dive deeply into the laws, but the main ideas of the laws are:
* Make it obvious -> Use and improve your environment to send you cues that will trigger you to start the action
    * Make a plan; I will do X at Y in Z. 
    * Make a habit follows another habit; after X I will Y.
    * Make cues in your environment or switch to new environment.

* Make it attractive -> Hack your motivation and use your environment (family, friends, etc.) to help you build new habits and get rid of bad habits.
    * Choose groups that have the habits you want to build. We tend to get the habits of the groups we belong to.
    * Pair action you need to do with something you want to do
    * Highlight benefit of avoiding bad habits

* Make it easy ->  To form a new habit, it has to be easy. You don't have to think too much at first. Then, you can optimize the process. As a counter rule, make bad habits hard in order to get rid of them. 
    * Make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible
    * Make a choice now with great impact in the future
    * 2 minutes rules (new habits should take less than 2 minutes to accomplish)
    * Use technology to automate behavior


* Make it satisfying ->  To stick to a habit, you have to get a reward from it. 
    * Stick to it everyday, you might feel some progress
    * have a habit tracker, you will feel proud to stick to your habit, or bad if you don't
    * Have an accountability partner, you will get a direct reaction from them (feel punished), either you progress in your habit or skip it.
    * Make cost of violating your habit public and painful.

### The 2-minutes rule
The two-minutes rule is a strategy to help you stick to a new habit.
It is designed to make the habit easy to follow. Don't make your new habit last more than two minutes at first. This way, it is easy to set up and realize and you might do it more often.
As a counter rule, try to make bad habits longer. For example, if you want to watch less TV, unplug the cable after watching TV and keep it in the closet far from the TV.

### Goldilocks rule
The Goldilocks rule helps you stay motivated. It as rule that can be applied when learning a new skill.
The point is that your habit should always challenge you a bit, but not too much.
If it is too easy, you get bored. If it is too hard, you get frustrated. The point is to keep it in 
a range that keeps motivating you. 
For example, you can run 10 km. Try to go for 13. If you go for 5 it is too easy, for 25 too hard.
