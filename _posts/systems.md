# Understand systems
Wikipedia defines a complex system as "a system composed of many components which may interact with each other". 
Complex systems are everywhere. Your car, your smartphone, plants, etc. Your city or you company can also be defined as a complex system. Indeed, there might be several levels of hierarchy, several departments. A person in your department at your company might depend on another person's work in another department that depends on a person's work in another department or company, etc. 

Understanding these complex systems is a fundamental skill. Imagine yourself working at a company and not understading how the various departements or offices are linked to each other, or, ignoring the hierarchy and how the information or commandment flow from the president of the company down to you. Same things happens in your country, if you don't know how works the political system at work, or all the administration you have to deal with everyday.  

## The hacker's mind
Most people think a hacker is a malicious person trying to make profit by attacking people using their computers. Well, no! 
A hacker is a person with a special mindset that studies a system to understand how it works. Once they got the knowledge, they can get their way around in that particular system and make it do things that, maybe, the system was not designed to do in the first place. The famous Hacker Manifesto explains this mindset very well.
